This is the blog dedicated to the support and promotion of new features and all the questions and answers related to the AI editor we created not that long ago.

Currently, the Tema editor is not in the active development phase, but in the last release, we gave users the option to use their own personal API keys to ensure they can select whatever service is available to them and work better.

We have a few things in the pipeline that we may implement in future versions of the editor.

Currently, there are many other more comprehensive options that may not cover all the functionality we have, but they have a larger team and greater support.

We are happy if you enjoy our product, and we continue to support you with it, but generally speaking, we do not expect it to be the best way to deal with similar tasks at the moment. Unless you want to stay away from cloud services, just because the Tema editor has the ability to keep all the data in one file, which is your file. *You own this file*.

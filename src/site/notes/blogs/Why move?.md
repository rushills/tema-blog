We decided to move to another platform, and the decision is not so obvious. 

Why bother if the app is not in an active development stage? 

But in fact, we have quite a few ideas we would like to implement in these two or a set of new tools. We haven't made a decision yet on where we can use the experience we gained building the editor. In fact, we would like to provide you with more ideas on how you can use AI in your personal workforce to help you write better texts and stay creative. 

We strongly believe that AI is a good co-pilot and can and should be used for processing the data you have, but we do not really believe that it should do creative work instead of you. It is something that is never tired and always ready to help, which is great, but you better do it with real facts, with real data from your own hands, just because if you don't do that, it will provide you with some information it found somewhere else, and it can be totally false.

Please stay tuned for the changes, for the voices and our thoughts about the usage of AI in different aspects of your life And we will be bringing the history of the blog from other platforms for your reference, the history of releases, etc.
